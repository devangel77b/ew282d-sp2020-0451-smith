abstract = {An upright posture in the water column may expose benthic marine organisms to faster flow higher in the water column than near the substratum, potentially increasing rates of mass exchange while also exposing the organisms to higher hydrodynamic forces. Benthic organisms maintain upright postures in the water column by one of two mechanisms, stiffness or buoyancy. Turbinaria ornata is a tropical macroalga that uses either buoyancy or flexural stiffness (EI), depending on its flow habitat. This study used physical models of T. ornata to compare the effect of different magnitudes of these two mechanisms on relative water velocity and hydrodynamic forces in both unidirectional and wavy flow. Models of the alga were constructed to span and exceed natural levels of T. ornata's EI and buoyancy. Models with high EI and high buoyancy maintained upright postures in both unidirectional flow and waves, and experienced higher forces than models with low EI and moderate or low buoyancy that deflected in the direction of water motion. In waves, buoyant models that were deflected by high velocity rebounded back into upright positions when the flow slowed. Non-buoyant, flexible models were also pushed over by flow but lacked the ability to rebound upright, which led to decreased force in unidirectional flow, but high force in waves.},

abstract = {Macroalgae use flexibility and reconfiguration, i.e. the alteration of shape, size and orientation as water velocity increases, to reduce the hydrodynamic forces imposed in the wave-swept rocky intertidal zone. Quantifying the effects of flexibility on hydrodynamic performance is difficult, however, because the mechanisms of reconfiguration vary with water velocity and the relationship between algal solid mechanics and hydrodynamic performance is poorly understood. In this study, the hydrodynamic performance, morphology and solid mechanics of 10 rocky shore macroalgal species were quantified to evaluate the influences of flexibility and morphology on reconfiguration. Hydrodynamic performance was measured in a flume by direct measurement of changes in size and shape during reconfiguration across a wide range of velocities, material stiffness was quantified with standard materials testing, and structural properties were calculated from material and morphological data. Hydrodynamic parameters varied significantly among species, indicating variation in the magnitude of reconfiguration and the velocities required for full reconfiguration. Structural properties also varied among species, and were correlated with hydrodynamic performance in some instances. The relationship between hydrodynamic and structural properties is velocity dependent, such that flexibility influences different aspects of reconfiguration at low and high velocities. Groups are identifiable among species based on hydrodynamic and structural properties, suggesting that these properties are useful for addressing functional-form hypotheses and the effects of hydrodynamic disturbance on macroalgal communities.},

So, there is a mechanical problem for beetles. They must be able to unfold their hind wings before flight and to fold them afterwards. This has to be repeatable: the wings would not be of much use for the beetle if unfolding could be done only once. To make 
things even more complicated, the driving musculature is in the thorax, but, the folded region is at the tip of the wing. There is no musculature in the wing. How do Coleoptera do this? },

abstract = {Flexible plants, fungi and sessile animals reconfigure in wind and water to reduce the drag acting upon them. In strong winds and flood waters, for example, leaves roll up into cone shapes that reduce drag compared with rigid objects of similar surface area. Less understood is how a leaf attached to a flexible leaf stalk will roll up stably in an unsteady flow. Previous mathematical and physical models have only considered the case of a flexible sheet attached to a rigid tether in steady flow. In this paper, the dynamics of the flow around the leaf of the wild ginger Hexastylis arifolia and the wild violet Viola papilionacea are described using particle image velocimetry. The flows around the leaves are compared with those of simplified physical and numerical models of flexible sheets attached to both rigid and flexible beams. In the actual leaf, a stable recirculation zone is formed within the wake of the reconfigured cone. In the physical model, a similar recirculation zone is observed within sheets constructed to roll up into cones with both rigid and flexible tethers. Numerical simulations and experiments show that flexible rectangular sheets that reconfigure into U-shapes, however, are less stable when attached to flexible tethers. In these cases, larger forces and oscillations due to strong vortex shedding are measured. These results suggest that the three-dimensional cone structure in addition to flexibility is significant to both the reduction of vortex-induced vibrations and the forces experienced by the leaf. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {Contents Summary Climatic extremes can be as significant as averages in setting the conditions for successful organismal function and in determining the distribution of different forms. For lightweight, flexible structures such as leaves, even extremes lasting a few seconds can matter. The present review considers two extreme situations that may pose existential risks. Broad leaves heat rapidly when ambient air flows drop below c. 0.5 m s-1. Devices implicated in minimizing heating include: reduction in size, lobing, and adjustments of orientation to improve convective cooling; low near-infrared absorptivity; and thickening for short-term heat storage. Different features become relevant when storm gusts threaten to tear leaves and uproot trees with leaf-level winds of 20 m s-1or more. Both individual leaves and clusters may curl into low-drag, stable cones and cylinders, facilitated by particular blade shapes, petioles that twist readily, and sufficient low-speed instability to initiate reconfiguration. While such factors may have implications in many areas, remarkably little relevant experimental work has addressed them. {\textcopyright} New Phytologist (2009).},

abstract = {Leaves of a forest-floor plant, Hexastylis arifolia, were subjected to rapid water movement at shallow depths to approximate sheet-flow conditions during flooding. When held {\textless}20 mm beneath the water's surface by the basal ends of their petioles, leaves surfaced, apparently through hydrodynamic lift, and aquaplaned with very low drag relative to surface area. When held {\textgreater}20 mm below the water surface, leaves curled into cones that had higher drag. Both measured and extrapolated drag of aquaplaning and submerged leaves were well below petiole breaking strength. Leaves of some other herbaceous plants that might occasionally be exposed to sheet flow behaved similarly; most had blades with upwardly curved basal lobes and fairly long petioles. Tree leaves with similar basal lobes and long petioles did not aquaplane. The biological significance of low drag during aquaplaning remains uncertain because petiole strength and root strength should be enough to hold the plant in place during sheet flow even without aquaplaning. Moreover, flooding with sheet flow is a rare event for most of these plants. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The North American Benthological Society.},

abstract = {We present observations and experimental results supporting the view that macroalgal morphology can represent a balance between maximizing photosynthetic ability and limiting susceptibility of the thallus to mechanical damage. The relationships among morphology, water flow, and photosynthesis were examined for five algal species representing three functional forms of marine macroalgae at Santa Catalina Island, California, USA. The relationship between surface area/volume ratio (SA/V) and rates of biomass-specific net photosynthesis (NP) across functional-form groups was examined to test the hypothesis that NP is related positively to SA/V. The rate of NP increased with increasing SA/V across functional groups. This relationship then was examined within a functional group for two species, Dictyopteris undulata and Zonaria farlowii, which are morphologically variable among sites. Flow measurements and morphometric analysis of thalli of D. undulata and Z. farlowii at two wave-exposed and two wave-protected sites indicated that intraspecific morphological variation corresponded to variation in wave exposure. A field experiment that manipulated rates of flow in situ resulted in morphological changes in D. undulata and Z. farlowii, indicating that water motion was responsible for the observed morphological plasticity. To examine the interaction between morphology and water flow on algal physiology, NP was estimated for morphotypes of D. undulata and Z. farlowii from wave-exposed and wave-protected sites. At saturating photon flux densities, NP was affected significantly by flow speed, particularly for morphotypes from the wave-protected site. For these morphotypes, increased flow speeds resulted in sustained, then decreased NP as flow speeds exceeded 17 cm/s, suggesting that water flow may affect NP at low flow speeds by mitigating mass transfer limitation and at high flow speeds by changing light interception and flow within the compacted thallus. The plasticity of morphologies and the interaction of these morphotypes with flow may represent a trade-off between maximizing NP and reducing the susceptibility of the thallus to mechanical damage and/or dislodgement by hydrodynamic forces.},

abstract = {An upright posture in the water column exposes benthic marine organisms to faster flow than near the substratum, potentially increasing rates of mass exchange while also exposing the organisms to higher hydrodynamic forces. Benthic organisms maintain upright postures in the water column by two mechanisms, being stiff or being buoyant. This study compared how different relative magnitudes of buoyancy and flexural stiffness (EI) affect hydrodynamic forces on, and flow velocity relative to the surfaces of the tropical alga, Turbinaria ornata. Thalli of T. ornata from wave-exposed forereef environments lack pneumatocysts (air bladders) and are negatively buoyant, but have higher EI than buoyant thalli with pneumatocysts from calm lagoon environments. Simultaneous measurements of water velocity, horizontal force and algal motion were recorded for pairs of thalli of the same height-positioned side by side on the reef at a site exposed to moderate wave action. To examine the effect of buoyancy alone, lagoon thalli with intact air-filled pneumatocysts were compared with lagoon algae that were made non-buoyant by replacing the air in their pneumatocysts with water. The non-buoyant thalli experienced higher water velocities and hydrodynamic forces than lagoon thalli with bladders. To test the effect of EI alone, flexible lagoon algae with water-filled pneumatocysts were compared to non-buoyant, stiff forereef algae and there was no difference in the relative water velocity or force they experienced. To compare thalli held upright by possessing a high EI to those held upright by buoyancy, lagoon algae with pneumatocysts were compared to forereef algae. Stiff forereef algae deflected very little in moving water. Water velocities relative to their surfaces and the peak horizontal forces they experienced were higher than those on more flexible lagoon algae, which bent easily and moved with the flow. Thus, buoyant, flexible thalli of T. ornata that move with the flow experience lower relative velocities and lower forces than stiff, non-buoyant thalli that do not move with the flow. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Many aspects of morphology of benthic algae (length, surface area-to-volume ratio, and blade undulation) are plastic traits that vary in response to physical factors (such as light or water flow environment). This study examines whether frond buoyancy is a plastic trait, and whether differences in morphology including buoyancy affect the potential persistence of macroalgae in habitats characterized by different water flow regimes. Fronds of the tropical alga Turbinaria ornata in protected backreef environments in Moorea, French Polynesia possess pneumatocysts (gas-filled floats) and experience positive buoyant forces, whereas fronds in wave-exposed forereef sites either lack pneumatocysts entirely or have very small, rudimentary pneumatocysts and experience negative buoyant forces. Forereef fronds transplanted to the backreef developed pneumatocysts and experienced increased buoyant force indicating that buoyancy is a phenotypically plastic trait in T. ornata. In comparing the potential for dislodgement by drag, drag was greater on forereef fronds at low flow speeds as these fronds were stiffer and did not bend over at low flow speeds and therefore were less streamlined in the flow than backreef algae, which bent easily. The environmental stress factor (ESF) (a measure of the likelihood of detachment for a frond in its habitat) was higher for forereef than backreef fronds at all flow speeds. When examined with respect to the flow velocities likely in their respective habitats however, the chance of detachment for backreef and forereef was similar. Neither backreef nor forereef fronds were predicted to break under normal, non-storm conditions, but both were predicted to break in storms. Strong forereef morphologies are well suited to habitats characterized by rapid flow, whereas the weaker, buoyant, tall backreef fronds are well suited to habitats where crowding and shading is common but hydrodynamic forces are low. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2006.},

Obviously, measurements of the spatial and temporal distribution of loads on an organism in nature reveal the magnitudes and rates at which biomechanical tests should be performed in the laboratory. Furthermore, knowledge of the population biology and ecological interactions of the organisms being studied is crucial to determine when during the life of an individual particular aspects of mechanical performance should be measured; not only can the size, shape and material properties of an individual change during ontogeny, but so can its habitat, activities and ecological role. Such ecological information is also necessary to determine whether the aspects of mechanical performance being studied are biologically important, i.e. whether they affect the survivorship or fitness of the organisms. My point in raising these examples is to illustrate how ecological studies can enhance or change our understanding of biomechanical function.},

abstract = {Ecological studies often focus on average effects of environmental factors, but ecological dynamics may depend as much upon environmental extremes. Ecology would therefore benefit from the ability to predict the frequency and severity of extreme environmental events. Some extreme events (e. g., earthquakes) are simple events: either they happen or they don't, and they are generally difficult to predict. In contrast, extreme ecological events are often compound events, resulting from the chance coincidence of run-of-the-mill factors. Here we present an environmental bootstrap method for resampling short-term environmental data (rolling the environmental dice) to calculate an ensemble of hypothetical time series that embodies how the physical environment could potentially play out differently. We use this ensemble in conjunction with mechanistic models of physiological processes to analyze the biological consequences of environmental extremes. Our resampling method provides details of these consequences that would be difficult to obtain otherwise, and our methodology can be applied to a wide variety of ecological systems. Here, we apply this approach to calculate return times for extreme hydrodynamic and thermal events on intertidal rocky shores. Our results demonstrate that the co-occurrence of normal events can indeed lead to environmental extremes, and that these extremes can cause disturbance. For example, the limpet Lottia gigantea and the mussel Mytilus californianus are co-dominant competitors for space on wave-swept rocky shores, but their response to extreme environmental events differ. Limpet mortality can vary drastically through time. Average yearly maximum body temperature of L. gigantea on horizontal surfaces is low, sufficient to kill fewer than 5{\%} of individuals, but on rare occasions environmental factors align by chance to induce temperatures sufficient to kill {\textgreater}99{\%} of limpets. In contrast, mussels do not exhibit large temporal variation in the physical disturbance caused by breaking waves, and this difference in the pattern of disturbance may have ecological consequences for these competing species. The effect of environmental extremes is under added scrutiny as the frequency of extreme events increases in response to anthropogenically forced climate change. Our method can be used to discriminate between chance events and those caused by long-term shifts in climate.},

Here we present an environmental bootstrap method for resampling short-term environmental data (rolling the environmental dice) to calculate an ensemble of hypothetical time series that embodies how the physical environment could potentially play out differently. We use this ensemble in conjunction with mechanistic models of physiological processes to analyze the biological consequences of environmental extremes. Our resampling method provides details of these consequences that would be difficult to obtain otherwise, and our methodology can be applied to a wide variety of ecological systems. Here, we apply this approach to calculate return times for extreme hydrodynamic and thermal events on intertidal rocky shores. Our results demonstrate that the co-occurrence of normal events can indeed lead to environmental extremes, and that these extremes can cause disturbance. For example, the limpet Lottia gigantea and the mussel Mytilus californianus are co-dominant competitors for space on wave-swept rocky shores, but their response to extreme environmental events differ. Limpet mortality can vary drastically through time. Average yearly maximum body temperature of L. gigantea on horizontal surfaces is low, sufficient to kill fewer than 5{\%} of individuals, but on rare occasions environmental factors align by chance to induce temperatures sufficient to kill {\textgreater}99{\%} of limpets. In contrast, mussels do not exhibit large temporal variation in the physical disturbance caused by breaking waves, and this difference in the pattern of disturbance may have ecological consequences for these competing species. The effect of environmental extremes is under added scrutiny as the frequency of extreme events increases in response to anthropogenically forced climate change. Our method can be used to discriminate between chance events and those caused by long-term shifts in climate.},

abstract = {Ecological studies often focus on average effects of environmental factors, but ecological dynamics may depend as much upon environmental extremes. Ecology would therefore benefit from the ability to predict the frequency and severity of extreme environmental events.
