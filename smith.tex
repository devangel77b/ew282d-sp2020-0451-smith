\begin{abstract}
This study was conducted to investigate how effectively citrus plants can change their structure to reduce drag in wind. An elastic cord was attached to a young grapefruit (\Citrusxparadisi) plant and a rigid aluminum physical model of one of its leaves, in the presence of flow from a small fan.  Cord displacement was used to quantify drag, while the area normal to flow was obtained from image analysis using color thresholding and blob detection. The drag experienced by the rigid model was 19\% higher than the drage measured on the live plant, and slow motion video analysis indicated that this was the result of the citrus's ability to bend at the petiole. The extreme bending in several directions suggests a method of protective load shedding and may also indicate a potential way to avoid flow induced vibrational loads from vortex shedding.
